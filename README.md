# labyrinth
A small 2d game made in 2018 with [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) and [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

The player moves around a grid to try and collect more treasures than the AI opponent. The majority of the game was playing with tiles, sprite assets, and a pathfinding algorithm for the opponent.
